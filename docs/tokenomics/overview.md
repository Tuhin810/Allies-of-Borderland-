## 📈 Token Economics

### Revenue Model

1. Token purchases (100% of ETH paid)
2. Platform fees (2% of every game pot)
3. Room creation fees (10 RC per room)

**Players earn from**:
1. Winning games (98% of pots)
2. Skillful play over time
3. Tournament prizes (future)

### Economic Flow

```
User Buys RC (ETH → Platform)
     ↓
User Stake in Games
     ↓
98% to Winners ← → 2% to Platform
     ↓
Winners Re-stake or Hold
```

### Sustainability
- **House Edge**: 2% ensures platform viability
- **Skill-Based**: Winners profit, losers pay
- **Zero-Sum (minus fees)**: Total RC constant per game
- **Long-term**: Skilled players accumulate tokens
