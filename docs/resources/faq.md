**Advanced**: 100-500 RC (high risk, high reward)

**Pro Tip**: Never stake more than you're willing to lose!

### What's the platform fee?
**2% of every game pot**

**Example**:

- Total pot: 500 RC
- Platform fee: 10 RC (2%)

**Why the fee?**
- Sustains platform development
- Covers server and infrastructure costs
- Funds future features and tournaments

### Can I profit from this game?
**Yes, if you're skilled**:
- Skilled players achieve >51% win rate

### What's ROI (Return on Investment)?
**ROI** = (Winnings - Stake) ÷ Stake × 100%

**Examples**:

- Stake 100 RC, lose → ROI = -100%
- Win as sole survivor (4-player game, 400 RC pot):
  - Receive 392 RC (after 2% fee)
  - ROI = (392 - 100) / 100 = +292%
