## 🎯 Game Overview

### The Premise
You and 3-5 other players enter the Borderland, a mysterious realm where survival depends on identifying and eliminating the **Jack**—a traitor among you. Each round, players must guess their assigned suit correctly or face elimination.

### The Twist
One player is secretly the Jack, whose goal is to deceive others and ensure their elimination. Citizens must work together (but not too closely) to expose the Jack before it's too late.

### The Stakes
Every player stakes RC tokens to enter. Survivors split the pot equally, while losers forfeit their stake. Strategy, deception, and timing determine who walks away with rewards.
