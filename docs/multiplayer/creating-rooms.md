## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Beginners

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient balance to create room"
- You need **10 RC fee + your stake amount**
- Example: 100 RC buy-in requires 110 RC total
- Purchase more tokens or lower the buy-in

### Players can't join my room
- Check that room isn't full (capacity reached)
- Ensure players meet buy-in requirement
- Verify they have camera/audio access

### Room disappeared after creation
- Browser crash or connection loss
- Contact support with Room ID for investigation
