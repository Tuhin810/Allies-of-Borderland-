# What is Allies of Borderland?

**Allies of Borderland** is a competitive social deduction game that combines psychological strategy, blockchain technology, and real-time video interaction to create an intense survival experience where every decision carries economic weight.

## 🎭 The Concept

Imagine a world where trust is a luxury you can't afford, where hidden agendas drive every conversation, and where survival depends on your ability to read opponents, manipulate information, and make split-second decisions under pressure.

That's the **Borderland**.

In each game, 3-6 players enter a high-stakes match where **one player is secretly a traitor** (the Jack), and the rest are Citizens trying to expose them. Over multiple rounds, players must:
- Guess their randomly assigned suit correctly
- Identify suspicious behavior through live video discussion
- Eliminate the Jack before they eliminate the Citizens
- Stake cryptocurrency tokens with potential for profit

## 🃏 The Gameplay Loop

### Round Structure
Each game consists of multiple rounds with **two distinct phases**:

#### 1. **Discussion Phase** (4 minutes)
- All players see each other via live video
- Open discussion about who might be the Jack
- Players can lie, accuse, defend, or form alliances
- No game actions allowed—pure social interaction

#### 2. **Jail Phase** (1 minute)
- Video disabled, chat locked
- Players secretly select their suit guess (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades)
- Correct guess = survival
- Incorrect guess = elimination
- Results revealed simultaneously

### Win Conditions
- **Citizens Win**: If they eliminate the Jack
- **Jack Wins**: If they survive with 2 or fewer total players remaining
- **Survivors**: Split the staked pot (98% after 2% platform fee)

---

## 💰 The Economic Layer

Unlike traditional games, Allies of Borderland integrates **real economic stakes** through RC (Redemption Credits) tokens:

- **Entry Requirement**: Players stake RC tokens to participate
- **Risk/Reward**: Survivors earn profits, losers forfeit stakes
- **Blockchain-Backed**: All tokens are Ethereum-based (ERC-20 standard)
- **Transparent Fees**: Only 2% platform fee per game
- **No House Edge**: Winners receive 98% of the pot—no hidden cuts

This creates a **skill-based economy** where strategic players can profit through superior gameplay.

## 🎯 What Makes It Unique?

### 1. **True Social Deduction**
Unlike text-based deduction games, Allies of Borderland uses **live video and audio**, allowing players to:
- Read facial expressions and body language
- Detect vocal hesitation and stress
- Build trust (or manipulate it) through conversation
- Create complex social dynamics

### 2. **Randomized Hidden Information**
Every player receives a **random suit** each round that changes after survival. This creates:
- Uncertainty even for the Jack
- No perfect information for anyone
- Constant tension and unpredictability
- Skill-based gameplay (not just luck)

### 3. **Economic Consequences**
Every game has **real stakes** through RC tokens:
- Winners profit from their skill
- Losers pay for mistakes
- House only takes 2% (fair and transparent)
- Aligns incentives toward strategic play

### 4. **Decentralized Technology**
Built on **P2P (peer-to-peer) and blockchain**:
- No central servers for video (privacy-focused)
- Ethereum smart contracts for token integrity
- Transparent, verifiable transactions
- Player-hosted rooms (decentralized matchmaking)

## 🌟 Core Mechanics

### Role System
Each game has **one Jack** and the rest are **Citizens**:

**Jack (Traitor)**
- Goal: Eliminate all Citizens without being caught
- Can lie about their suit
- Wins if ≤2 players remain
- Knows they're the Jack, others don't know who it is

**Citizen (Majority)**
- Goal: Survive and identify the Jack
- Must guess suit correctly each round
- Win by eliminating the Jack
- Must deduce who the traitor is through social cues

### Suit Prediction Mechanic
The heart of the game:
1. Each player is secretly assigned a suit (Hearts ♥, Diamonds ♦, Clubs ♣, Spades ♠)
2. Players must guess their own suit during Jail phase
3. Correct guess = survive, incorrect = eliminated
4. Suits change each round for survivors (randomized again)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Players can truthfully reveal their suit to build trust
- Players can lie to manipulate others
- The Jack might incorrectly guess to frame others
- Information shared in Discussion phase becomes critical
