# Key Features

Allies of Borderland combines innovative mechanics, blockchain technology, and social psychology to deliver a unique gaming experience. Here are the standout features that set it apart.

---

## 🎥 Live Video & Audio Communication

### Real-Time Face-to-Face Interaction
Unlike text-based social deduction games, Allies of Borderland leverages **WebRTC peer-to-peer video** to enable genuine human interaction:

- **See Your Opponents**: Observe facial expressions, micro-reactions, and tells
- **Hear Vocal Cues**: Detect hesitation, confidence, or deception in voice tone
- **Build Social Dynamics**: Form alliances, intimidate rivals, or play diplomat
- **Privacy-Focused**: P2P connections mean no video data passes through central servers

### Discussion Phase Strategy
The 4-minute discussion window becomes a psychological battleground:
- Openly discuss who might be the Jack
- Share (or fabricate) information about your suit
- Call out suspicious behavior
- Defend yourself against accusations
- Read opponents' body language for clues

## 🃏 Dynamic Role System

### Jack vs. Citizens
Every game features **asymmetric roles** with different objectives:

#### **The Jack (Traitor)**
- **Objective**: Survive with ≤2 total players
- **Advantage**: Knows their role (others don't know who the Jack is)
- **Challenge**: Must deceive without revealing identity
- **Strategy**: Manipulate information, create chaos, frame innocent players

#### **Citizens (Majority)**
- **Objective**: Identify and eliminate the Jack
- **Challenge**: Limited information, must trust but verify
- **Strategy**: Build alliances, share information, analyze behavior
- **Advantage**: Numerical majority if they work together

### Random Assignment
- Roles are distributed randomly at game start
- No pattern or predictability
- Everyone starts with equal uncertainty
- Creates fresh dynamics every game

## 🎲 Suit Prediction Mechanic

### Hidden Information System
The core gameplay revolves around **suit guessing**:

1. **Secret Assignment**: Each player gets a random suit (♥ ♦ ♣ ♠)
2. **Guess Phase**: During Jail phase, privately select your guess
3. **Simultaneous Reveal**: All results shown at once
4. **Survival/Elimination**: Correct = live, incorrect = eliminated
5. **Re-Randomization**: Survivors get new suits next round

### Strategic Depth
- **Truth-Telling**: Reveal your suit to build trust (risky if Jack lies)
- **Bluffing**: Lie about your suit to manipulate others
- **Observation**: Track who survives to deduce patterns
- **Probability**: Use elimination to narrow down Jack's identity

---

## ⏱️ Time Pressure Mechanics

### Phase Timers
Games are designed to create **intense pressure**:

#### Discussion Phase: **4 Minutes**
- Rapid-fire accusations and defenses
- Forces quick thinking and split-second decisions
- No time for perfect information gathering
- Mimics real-world high-pressure negotiations

#### Jail Phase: **60 Seconds**
- Silent, isolated decision-making
- No communication allowed (video/chat disabled)
- Final chance to commit to your guess
- Builds dramatic tension before reveal

### Psychological Impact
- **Decision Fatigue**: Players make errors under time constraints
- **Emotional Pressure**: Stress reveals authentic reactions
- **Skill Expression**: Better players thrive under pressure
- **Prevents Analysis Paralysis**: Forces action, not overthinking
