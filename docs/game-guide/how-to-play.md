## 🎯 Game Objective

### For Citizens
**Eliminate the Jack** before they eliminate you.

- Identify suspicious behavior in Discussion phases
- Correctly guess your suit each round to survive
- Work together (but don't trust blindly!)
- Win when the Jack is eliminated

### For the Jack
**Survive with 2 or fewer total players** remaining.

- Deceive others about your identity
- Create chaos and false accusations
- Manipulate information about suits
- Win when Citizens are reduced to ≤2 total

---

## 👥 Player Roles

Every game assigns **one Jack** and the rest are **Citizens**:

### The Jack (Traitor)
- **Knowledge**: Knows they are the Jack
- **Hidden Info**: Others don't know who the Jack is
- **Advantage**: Can lie with purpose
- **Challenge**: Must avoid suspicion
- **Win Condition**: Survive with ≤2 total players

### Citizens (Majority)
- **Knowledge**: Know they are Citizens
- **Hidden Info**: Don't know who the Jack is
- **Advantage**: Numerical majority
- **Challenge**: Limited information
- **Win Condition**: Eliminate the Jack

## 🃏 The Suit System

Every round, each player is assigned a **secret suit**:

### The Four Suits
- ♥ **Hearts**
- ♦ **Diamonds**
- ♣ **Clubs**
- ♠ **Spades**

### How It Works
1. **Assignment**: At round start, you're given a random suit
2. **Hidden**: Only you know your suit (if you're a Citizen)
3. **Guessing**: During Jail phase, you must guess your suit
4. **Survival**: Correct guess = live, incorrect = eliminated
5. **Re-Assignment**: Survivors get new random suits next round

> **Important**: The Jack also receives a suit and must guess correctly to survive!

## ⏱️ Game Phases

Each round consists of two distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Discussion (4 Minutes)

**What Happens**:
- All players can see each other via video
- Chat is enabled (voice and text)
- No game actions can be taken (just talk!)

**Your Goal**:
- Citizens: Identify the Jack through behavior
- Jack: Appear innocent, create doubt
- Everyone: Gather information about suits

**Strategies**:
- **Share Suit Info**: "I have Hearts, what about you?"
- **Accuse Others**: "Player 3 seems suspicious..."
- **Defend Yourself**: "I can't be the Jack, I survived last round!"
- **Form Alliances**: "Let's work together to find the Jack"
- **Read Body Language**: Watch for nervous ticks, lying cues

### Phase 2: Jail (60 Seconds)

**What Happens**:
- Video feed disabled (goes dark)
- Chat locked (no communication)
- UI shows 4 suit options: ♥ ♦ ♣ ♠
- Timer counts down from 60 seconds

**Your Action**:
1. Click on the suit you believe is yours
2. Selected suit highlights
3. Timer expires or you click "Confirm"
4. No going back after confirmation!

**Strategies**:
- **Trust Your Memory**: Recall what people said in Discussion
- **Probability**: If everyone claimed Hearts, maybe try something else
- **Intuition**: Sometimes your gut is right
- **Time Management**: Don't wait until the last second

### Phase 3: Resolution (Automatic)

**What Happens**:
- All players' results revealed simultaneously
- Correct guessers: ✅ Survived (stay alive)
- Incorrect guessers: ❌ Eliminated (out of game)
- Game checks win conditions

**Possible Outcomes**:
- **Jack Eliminated** → Citizens Win! (game ends)
- **≤2 Total Players** → Jack Wins! (game ends)
- **Jack Alive + >2 Players** → Next Round begins

## 💰 Stakes & Rewards

### Entry Requirements
- **Minimum Stake**: 1 RC
- **Maximum Stake**: Up to your full balance
- **Room Types**: Host sets fixed buy-in for multiplayer

### Pot Calculation
```
Total Pot = Sum of all player stakes
Platform Fee = 2% of pot
Winner Pool = 98% of pot
Per-Winner Reward = Winner Pool ÷ Number of Survivors
```

### Example 1: Single Winner
```
Players: 4
Stake: 100 RC each
Total Pot: 400 RC
Platform Fee: 8 RC (2%)
Winner Pool: 392 RC

Winner receives: 392 RC
Net profit: 392 - 100 = +292 RC (292% ROI!)
```

### Example 2: Multiple Winners
```
Players: 5
Stake: 50 RC each
Total Pot: 250 RC
Platform Fee: 5 RC (2%)
Winner Pool: 245 RC
Survivors: 3

Each winner receives: 245 ÷ 3 = 81.67 RC
Net profit: 81.67 - 50 = +31.67 RC (63% ROI)
```

## 🎯 Strategy Tips

### As a Citizen

**Early Game**:
- Share your suit truthfully to build trust
- Observe who hesitates when asked about their suit
- Take note of aggressive accusers (could be Jack deflecting)

**Mid Game**:
- Track who survives consistently (unlikely to be guessing wrong)
- Watch for players who contradict themselves
- Form alliances but verify claims

**Late Game**:
- If it's down to 3-4 players, focus on process of elimination
- The Jack will try to cause chaos—stay calm and logical

### As the Jack

**Early Game**:
- Act like a Citizen: share "your suit" confidently
- Don't be too quiet (suspicious) or too loud (overcompensating)
- Accuse someone else to deflect attention

**Mid Game**:
- Sow discord: "I think Player 2 and 4 are working together..."
- If caught in a lie, play it off as misremembering

**Late Game**:
- If you're down to final few, lean into chaos
- Make everyone doubt each other
- Survive just one more round to win!

## 📊 Winning Scenarios

### Citizens Win If:
- Jack guessed their suit incorrectly (eliminated)
- Group correctly identifies and pressures Jack into mistake

### Jack Wins If:
- Reduces total players to 2 or fewer
- Successfully deceives Citizens until they eliminate each other

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### For Citizens
- ❌ **Trusting too quickly**: Don't believe everything you hear
- ❌ **Ignoring behavior**: Body language reveals lies
- ❌ **Random guessing**: Use information from Discussion
- ❌ **Not communicating**: Silence makes you suspicious

### For the Jack
- ❌ **Over-acting**: Being too defensive stands out
- ❌ **Staying silent**: Quiet players draw suspicion
- ❌ **Contradicting yourself**: Keep track of your lies
- ❌ **Giving up too early**: Even if accused, deny and deflect!

---

## 🎥 Video & Communication

### Camera Tips
- **Show your face**: Helps build trust (and catch liars)
- **Good lighting**: Make sure you're visible
- **Stable connection**: Poor video quality hurts social reads

### Communication Tactics
- **Mirroring**: Repeat back what others say to build rapport
- **Direct questions**: "Player 3, what is your suit?"
- **Body language**: Lean in when serious, relax when confident

---

## 🏆 Advanced Techniques

### Information Asymmetry
- Keep track of who claims which suits
- If someone survives without stating their suit, investigate

### Psychological Pressure
- Call out specific players: "Why did you hesitate?"
- Create urgency: "We need to decide NOW"

### Probability Play
- If 3 people claim Hearts, the 4th probably isn't Hearts
- Use suit distribution to narrow down Jack's lies
